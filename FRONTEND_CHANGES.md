### 5. `components/navigation.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… **Previously Updated**

### 6. `components/job-list-page.tsx`
**Status**: âœ… **No Changes Needed**
- Uses JobCard components which already have proper modal integration
- Filtering and search functionality works independently
- No backend integration required at this level

## Integration Flow

### Application Submission Process:
1. User clicks "Apply Now" button (either from JobCard or JobDetailsModal)
2. ApplicationModal opens with comprehensive application form
3. User fills out form and uploads resume file
4. Form validation ensures all required fields are completed
5. `apiClient.submitApplication()` sends FormData to backend `/api/applications`
6. Backend processes application, stores in database, sends emails
7. Success/error feedback displayed to user
8. Modal closes and form resets on successful submission

### Job Viewing Process:
1. JobListPage displays filtered job cards
2. User can either:
   - Click "Apply Now" directly from JobCard â†’ Opens ApplicationModal
   - Click job details â†’ Opens JobDetailsModal â†’ Click "Apply Now" â†’ Opens ApplicationModal
3. Both paths lead to the same comprehensive application flow

## File Upload Integration

### Frontend Side:
- ApplicationModal handles file selection with validation
- FormData object created with all form fields + resume file
- API client sends multipart/form-data request to backend

### Backend Side (to be implemented):
- Multer middleware handles file upload
- Files stored in `uploads/` directory with unique names
- File path and metadata stored in database
- Email service sends notifications with application details

## API Endpoints Used

### Current Integration:
- `POST /api/applications` - Submit job application with file upload
- `GET /api/jobs` - Fetch job listings (existing functionality)

### Ready for Integration:
- Authentication endpoints (login, register, profile)
- Job management endpoints (create, update, delete)
- Application management endpoints (status updates, retrieval)

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend (Next.js):
- API client configured for `http://localhost:3001`
- CORS handled by backend configuration
- File upload limits handled by browser and backend

### Backend Requirements:
- Must run on port 3001 (or update API client base URL)
- CORS enabled for `http://localhost:3000`
- Multer configured for file uploads
- Supabase integration for database operations

## Testing Checklist

### âœ… Completed (Frontend):
- [x] ApplicationModal renders correctly
- [x] Form validation works
- [x] File upload selection works
- [x] API client properly configured
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Success feedback implemented

### ðŸ”„ Pending (Backend Setup):
- [ ] Backend server running on port 3001
- [ ] Database schema created in Supabase
- [ ] File upload directory created
- [ ] Email service configured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] End-to-end application submission test

## Key Features Implemented

   - Form reset after successful submission
   - Proper modal management and navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Setup**: Follow instructions in `BACKEND_SETUP.md`
2. **Database Configuration**: Execute SQL schema in Supabase
3. **Email Service**: Configure SMTP settings for notifications
4. **Testing**: Verify end-to-end application submission flow
5. **Production Setup**: Configure production API endpoints and deploy
